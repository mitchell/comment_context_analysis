A certain variety of plant found all over the world, in every human-inhabited environment, produce leafs/fruits/vegetables containing human neurotransmitters, which are then refined by posthumans and injected directly into the bloodstream in order to increase that neurotransmitter's production. The refined stuff can be used to permanently alter a successor's personality over time, which was used by several dictators to maintain control of their populations; its historical misuse means that most nations heavily regulate it, and only allow it for medical purposes after being approved by wizards who understand it well. Poorly refined versions of the drug can cause the opposite effect - for example, dopamine might cause someone to permanently fall into a deep depression. Overuse of even the refined versions will cause a death spiral, causing a successor to fall into [Anderson Syndrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/552sxa/what_are_the_some_interestingbizzareterrible/d87c9gn), which is the lethal depression-like disorder that kills most successors.\n\nA technique created long ago lets people mix various different neurotransmitter-plants to create the planet's alcohol equivalent, with a variety of resulting experiences from mild inebriation to LSD/shroom trips, depending on the way it's made. Posthuman psychology means that mixes are less likely to cause Anderson Syndrome, and so this is much less regulated than the unmixed version. The more talented the maker of the mix is, the more the mix is an experience instead of a feeling.\n\nSome people argue that the plants feel, and so hurting them is normally considered animal abuse.\n\nThe plant itself adapts to its environment, coming in a lot of different varieties, although the most cultivated ones are massive underground flowering vines, urban trees with colorful fruits, flowers in rocky plains, and underwater coastal/reef kelp-like forests.","parent_id":"t3_559pj6","link_id":"t3_559pj6","subreddit":"worldbuilding","subreddit_id":"t5_2rd6n","retrieved_on":1478225199,"created_utc":1475280004,"stickied":false,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":"Succubi Catgirls, Kung-Fu Wizard Posthumans, and Magic AI","score":1}

It's not a very breathable material and overheating is a SIDS risk factor. Instead we're told to use merino or cotton for sleeping and to use multiple layers if it's cold (e.g. merino singlet, cotton sleeper, merino sleep sack). \n\nOne of our government research institutes, AgResearch, released a report in 2010 comparing a merino sleeping bag with a Halo polyester/fleece sleeping bag and concluded that the merino sleeping bag was a better choice. The [report is here](https://www.ikbenmama.nl/images/merino_onderzoek.pdf) if you want to read it.\n\nUltimately they're probably both fine, but there definitely seems to be a greater risk of baby overheating in a fleece sleepsack."}

ICANN (internet corporation for assigned names and numbers) holds the IANA role under contract from the US government and has for 18 years.\n\n&gt;This situation came about because 20 years ago, NSFNET (national science foundation network) provided MOST of the backbone capacity for the internet. The USCISI (university of southern california information sciences institute) acted as the master bgp route table.\n\n&gt;However, the job began to balloon as the internet grew and there was some grumblings of power games at USCISI and NetSol (Network Solutions) so the IANA role was created and contracted to ICANN.\n\n&gt;Fast forward to today.\n\n&gt;For nearly two decades, ICANN and the (now) five RIRs have done a pretty good job of managing the internet and the master bgp table. They've been fair to all parties involved, have generally strived to make the IETF's improvements happen, cooperated with the ITU (international telecommunications union), etc.\n\n&gt;But every two years they still have to renegotiate with the US government to continue to be the IANA.\n\n&gt;But why?\n\n&gt;What power does the US government have over them now?\nNSFNET is gone. ARPANET is LONG gone. Even the Abilene network (which was awesome when I was in college) has faded away as just one more link. The days when the government could claim to be a backbone provider are decades past.\n\n&gt;If for some political reason the US government decided to try to leverage its hypothetical power over ICANN, what \nthe hell could the US government possibly do if ICANN simply refused to work with them? Shut them down?\n\n&gt;The AS'es (autonomous systems; that is, individual networks) all listen to ICANN. The stability of the internet depends on SOMEONE being the master bgp table, and ICANN has done a pretty good job of it. Only one bgp table in the entire world can be canonical. The rest are just merely \"eventually consistent\".\nShut ICANN down and who's bgp table becomes canonical? The one the US government says?\n\n&gt;Or the one the ITU says? Mind you, the ITU is a UN agency all worldwide telecommunications providers ALREADY cooperate with.\nWhat would happen if the US government tried to wield its power, is that the ITU would walk in, name someone as the worldwide master bgp table, and that would be the end of it. With a pen stroke the US government would be written out of the picture, BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE. They aren't a major backbone provider.\n\n&gt;The tier 1 networks, the backbone providers, ALREADY listen to the ITU for matters of standardization. Its the ITU that tells them what orbits are safe for their comm satellites, what frequencies are safe for their microwave relays.","subreddit":"The_Donald","link_id":"t3_55aikj","subreddit_id":"t5_38unr","created_utc":1475280008,"retrieved_on":1478225205,"stickied":false,"author_flair_text":"USA","score":3,"controversiality":0}

The customer can always dispute the transaction, but I'd think that as long as you're dipping the chip, it will be the standard dispute process rather than the automatic incontestable chargeback. I would think you'd be able to ask your processor if customer-visible dipping is required for full liability coverage.\n\nThe current American system seems perfectly normal to us Americans, but in the past I've seen several conversions with foreigners who are completely aghast at the idea. In some countries it's unusual for an employee to even touch a customer's card, let alone walk away with it. \n\nWhen you start to think about it, there are two significant problems with the American system. One is that the card leaves the customer's sight, so the server can do whatever they want with it. Whether or not you use EMV, there's nothing to stop a malicious employee from running the card through a second fake reader that just captures the magnetic stripe details for later cloning; until magstripe use becomes as rare in the US as it is in other countries, that still has the potential to be an attractive fraud route. The second is the manual addition of tips later creates an opening for both innocent mistakes and intentional tip fraud.\n\nI agree that there's the potential for social awkwardness of having the server hovering over the customer while they're deciding on a tip amount. As someone who has done a fair bit of international travel, I lean towards saying just do it and eventually we Americans will get over it. I remember in Canada the portable terminals had options to select e.g. 15%, 18%, or 20%, or enter a custom amount. So that makes it quick to just hit a button and get on with it. I'd be curious to find out how many people really give it much thought how much they want to tip each time and how many people just basically tip 15% or 20% nearly every time unless the service was exceptionally good or bad.\n\nThere was also one restaurant in Norway that actually left the portable terminal at my table while I paid while the waitress attended to another task, and I also saw her do it with other customers.\n\nYou could also go to the extreme and adopt a \"no tipping\" model and just increase prices and salaries accordingly; I've heard a few US restaurants have done this.\n\nIt actually sounds like your Pax S90 device is a decent solution. Just because it's portable doesn't mean you have to do table-side payments. As long as you can do Chip and Signature (either with signature preferring cards or PIN-bypass) and add the tip later, you can keep doing things the way you always have. But if you do run into a card that requires a PIN, then you can easily bring the terminal back to the customer so they can enter tip and PIN.\n\nI have run into that. A couple of restaurants in Italy asked me if my card was PIN or signature, and after I said signature they took the card away American style and brought back the receipt for me to sign. And one place in London took the card away and somehow managed to get my signature preferring (but PIN-capable) card to do a Chip and PIN transaction and brought the portable terminal and card back to the table for me to enter the PIN.\n\nOne final thought (for now anyway) is that there is some speculation that US banks might be using Chip and Signature as an interim step and will eventually move to Chip and PIN. If that happens, adopting a portable terminal now would prevent another equipment change, especially if they take away the ability to do PIN bypass (as I hear happened in Australia a year or so ago).","parent_id":"t1_d88t8uf"}

I recognize there are a lot of people who have to deal with pain on an everyday basis but can't find relief. But the topic being discussed is people killing \"big pharm\" and physicians for overprescribing narcotic painkillers. Here's a secret: No well-meaning physician wants their patients to rely on painkillers. So many people who have no idea about health care think that physicians just hand it out like candy and would rather treat patients that way. The fact is that a lot of patients develop chronic pain and a fair percentage (read: NOT ALL) want instant relief rather than to work on a sustainable plan for that chronic pain.\n\nSo you have this group of people who bitch at physicians for getting people addicted to painkillers, even though it's at the patient's request that they be started on painkillers to deal with chronic pain. And then you have people similar to you who have legitimate chronic pain that requires a regimen of pain medication but know how to not let it control your lives, where physical therapy and other methods alone aren't effective.

{"parent_id":"t1_d88vqmo","body":"Obviously after week 3. I made the decision before that and the info I had was an 85 yd and 118 yd day w/ 0 TDs on the season. Our league is a .5 PPR and has only 4 bench players and no IR. I had Charles, Martin, Brady, and Watkins on my bench to drop. In hindsight, I should have dropped Watkins, but I have Evans and ARob too (both are top 3 in targets this year). I could have not played a TE, but I won by 0.9 pts by picking up Pitta. That could be the difference b/w making the playoffs or not w/ just 14 weeks. I also still believe D's will catch on to Jones (he's played the 28th, 13th, 29th ranked pass so far) and Tate should get some better looks. Still think Jones will end up top 15, but my other two WRs will likely be top 10.

And I mean that. I've gone years between dates even, because finding a relationship just to be dating someone wasn't my priority at the time. And you are correct, losing weight is directly related to how you eat and how you move. That's the case for every living thing on this planet. Long term results require long term changes.\n\nIf cardio is something you enjoy, that's great! There are a lot of really fun options out there. You might find, though, that you can get more out of the cardio if you supplement with weight training. For example, I want to be able to run a mile in a not laughable amount of time one day, but I have a lot of pain in my knees from an old injury. So with my doctor's advice and a trainer's help, I do exercises to develop strength in my knees, keeping them more stable and reducing the pain. It works!\n\nAs for the science classes taking up your time, I'm not entirely sure how my boyfriend got a science PhD while also spending hours in the gym. Honestly sounds like he didn't sleep for five years to me, poor man. That's definitely not for everyone. But to him, it was important to make his training a priority, and it still is.\n\nBest of luck as you find your way through college and the rest! Keep building yourself up and become the best person you can be, and I'm sure that eventually, you'll find someone who appreciates that and all you have to offer.","parent_id":"t1_d87qx7s"}
